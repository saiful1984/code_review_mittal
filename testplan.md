## Test Environment

### Development Environment
- Local development setup with mocked GitHub API
- Demo mode with predefined responses
- Unit tests running in CI/CD pipeline

### Staging Environment
- Integration with test GitHub repositories
- Simulated PR events
- Full system deployment with monitoring

### Production Environment
- Limited testing with real user repositories
- A/B testing of new features
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Test Data

1. **Sample Repositories**
   - Various programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
   - Different project sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Various code quality levels

2. **Sample PRs**
   - PRs with different types of changes (feature, bugfix, refactoring)
   - PRs with known issues (security vulnerabilities, performance issues)
   - PRs with different sizes (small, medium, large)

3. **Mock LLM Responses**
   - Predefined responses for testing without LLM API
   - Responses with different issue types and severities
   - Error responses for testing error handling

## Test Automation

### Unit Test Automation
- Pytest for Python components
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript components
- CI/CD integration for automated test runs

### Integration Test Automation
- API-level test automation with pytest
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Containerized test environment

### End-to-End Test Automation
- Selenium or Playwright for UI testing
- GitHub API simulation for webhook events
- Automated test data generation

## Test Schedule

1. **Development Phase**
